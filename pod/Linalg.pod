=item gsl_linalg_hessenberg_decomp($A, $tau) - This function computes the Hessenberg decomposition of the matrix $A by applying the similarity transformation H = U^T A U. On output, H is stored in the upper portion of $A. The information required to construct the matrix U is stored in the lower triangular portion of $A. U is a product of N - 2 Householder matrices. The Householder vectors are stored in the lower portion of $A (below the subdiagonal) and the Householder coefficients are stored in the vector $tau. tau must be of length N. The function returns 0 if it succeded, 1 otherwise.

=item gsl_linalg_hessenberg_unpack($H, $tau, $U) - This function constructs the orthogonal matrix $U from the information stored in the Hessenberg matrix $H along with the vector $tau. $H and $tau are outputs from gsl_linalg_hessenberg_decomp.

=item gsl_linalg_hessenberg_unpack_accum($H, $tau, $V) - This function is similar to gsl_linalg_hessenberg_unpack, except it accumulates the matrix U into $V, so that V' = VU. The matrix $V must be initialized prior to calling this function. Setting $V to the identity matrix provides the same result as gsl_linalg_hessenberg_unpack. If $H is order N, then $V must have N columns but may have any number of rows.

=item gsl_linalg_hessenberg_set_zero($H) - This function sets the lower triangular portion of $H, below the subdiagonal, to zero. It is useful for clearing out the Householder vectors after calling gsl_linalg_hessenberg_decomp.

The diagonal elements of the singular value matrix S are stored in the vector $S. The singular values are non-negative and form a non-increasing sequence from S_1 to S_N. The matrix $V contains the elements of V in untransposed form. To form the product U S V^T it is necessary to take the transpose of V. A workspace of length N is required in vector $work.

=item gsl_linalg_SV_decomp_jacobi($A, $V, $S) - This function computes the SVD of the M-by-N matrix $A using one-sided Jacobi orthogonalization for M >= N. The Jacobi method can compute singular values to higher relative accuracy than Golub-Reinsch algorithms. $V is a matrix while $S is a vector.

=item gsl_linalg_SV_solve($U, $V, $S, $b, $x) - This function solves the system A x = b using the singular value decomposition ($U, $S, $V) of A given by gsl_linalg_SV_decomp. Only non-zero singular values are used in computing the solution. The parts of the solution corresponding to singular values of zero are ignored. Other singular values can be edited out by setting them to zero before calling this function.

=item gsl_linalg_LU_invert($LU, $p, $inverse) - This function computes the inverse of a matrix A from its LU decomposition stored in the matrix $LU and the permutation $p, storing the result in the matrix $inverse.

=item gsl_linalg_LU_det($LU, $signum) - This function returns the determinant of a matrix A from its LU decomposition stored in the $LU matrix. It needs the integer $signum which is the sign of the permutation returned by gsl_linalg_LU_decomp.

=item gsl_linalg_QR_update($Q, $R, $b, $x) - This function performs a rank-1 update $w $v**T of the QR decomposition ($Q, $R). The update is given by Q'R' = Q R + w v^T where the output matrices Q' and R' are also orthogonal and right triangular. Note that w is destroyed by the update. The function returns 0 if it succeded, 1 otherwise.

=item gsl_linalg_QR_QTvec($QR, $tau, $v) - This function applies the matrix Q^T encoded in the decomposition ($QR,$tau) to the vector $v, storing the result Q^T v in $v.

=item gsl_linalg_complex_cholesky_solve($cholesky, $b, $x) - This function solves the system A x = b using the Cholesky decomposition of A into the matrix $cholesky given by gsl_linalg_complex_cholesky_decomp. $b and $x are vectors. The function returns 0 if the operation succeeded, 0 otherwise.

=item gsl_linalg_complex_cholesky_svx($cholesky, $x) - This function solves the system A x = b in-place using the Cholesky decomposition of A into the matrix $cholesky given by gsl_linalg_complex_cholesky_decomp. On input the vector $x should contain the right-hand side b, which is replaced by the solution on output. The function returns 0 if the operation succeeded, 0 otherwise.

=item gsl_linalg_symmtd_decomp($A, $tau) - This function factorizes the symmetric square matrix $A into the symmetric tridiagonal decomposition Q T Q^T. On output the diagonal and subdiagonal part of the input matrix $A contain the tridiagonal matrix T. The remaining lower triangular part of the input matrix contains the Householder vectors which, together with the Householder coefficients $tau, encode the orthogonal matrix Q. This storage scheme is the same as used by lapack. The upper triangular part of $A is not referenced. $tau is a vector.

=item gsl_linalg_symmtd_unpack($A, $tau, $Q, $diag, $subdiag) - This function unpacks the encoded symmetric tridiagonal decomposition ($A, $tau) obtained from gsl_linalg_symmtd_decomp into the orthogonal matrix $Q, the vector of diagonal elements $diag and the vector of subdiagonal elements $subdiag.

=item gsl_linalg_symmtd_unpack_T($A, $diag, $subdiag) - This function unpacks the diagonal and subdiagonal of the encoded symmetric tridiagonal decomposition ($A, $tau) obtained from gsl_linalg_symmtd_decomp into the vectors $diag and $subdiag.

=item gsl_linalg_hermtd_decomp($A, $tau) - This function factorizes the hermitian matrix $A into the symmetric tridiagonal decomposition U T U^T. On output the real parts of the diagonal and subdiagonal part of the input matrix $A contain the tridiagonal matrix T. The remaining lower triangular part of the input matrix contains the Householder vectors which, together with the Householder coefficients $tau, encode the orthogonal matrix Q. This storage scheme is the same as used by lapack. The upper triangular part of $A and imaginary parts of the diagonal are not referenced. $A is a complex matrix and $tau a complex vector.

=item gsl_linalg_hermtd_unpack($A, $tau, $U, $diag, $subdiag) - This function unpacks the encoded tridiagonal decomposition ($A, $tau) obtained from gsl_linalg_hermtd_decomp into the unitary complex  matrix $U, the real vector of diagonal elements $diag and the real vector of subdiagonal elements $subdiag.

=item gsl_linalg_hermtd_unpack_T($A, $diag, $subdiag) - This function unpacks the diagonal and subdiagonal of the encoded tridiagonal decomposition (A, tau) obtained from the gsl_linalg_hermtd_decomp into the real vectors $diag and $subdiag.

=item gsl_linalg_HH_solve($a, $b, $x) - This function solves the system $A $x = $b directly using Householder transformations where $A is a matrix, $b and $x vectors. On output the solution is stored in $x and $b is not modified. $A is destroyed by the Householder transformations.

=item gsl_linalg_HH_svx($A, $x) - This function solves the system $A $x = b in-place using Householder transformations where $A is a matrix, $b is a vector. On input $x should contain the right-hand side b, which is replaced by the solution on output. The matrix $A is destroyed by the Householder transformations.

 You have to add the functions you want to use inside the qw /put_function_here / with spaces between each function. You can also write use Math::GSL::Complex qw/:all/ to use all available functions of the module.

For more informations on the functions, we refer you to the GSL official documentation: L<http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/>

=head1 EXAMPLES

This example shows how to compute the determinant of a matrix with the LU decomposition:

 use Math::GSL::Matrix qw/:all/;
 use Math::GSL::Permutation qw/:all/;
 use Math::GSL::Linalg qw/:all/;

 my $Matrix = gsl_matrix_alloc(4,4);
 map { gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 0, $_, $_+1) } (0..3);

 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix,1, 0, 2);
 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 1, 1, 3);
 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 1, 2, 4);
 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 1, 3, 1);

 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 2, 0, 3);
 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 2, 1, 4);
 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 2, 2, 1);
 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 2, 3, 2);

 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 3, 0, 4);
 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 3, 1, 1);
 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 3, 2, 2);
 gsl_matrix_set($Matrix, 3, 3, 3);

 my $permutation = gsl_permutation_alloc(4);
 gsl_permutation_init($permutation);
 my ($result, $signum) = gsl_linalg_LU_decomp($Matrix, $permutation);
 my $det = gsl_linalg_LU_det($Matrix, $signum);
 print "The value of the determinant of the matrix is $det \n";
