Math::GSL

Math::GSL is an interface to the GNU Scientific Library, using SWIG.  The GNU
Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers. It
is free software under the GNU General Public License.  Math::GSL uses SWIG to
generate Perl bindings to *most* GSL functionality.

Currently Math::GSL requires at least Perl 5.8 and GSL 1.11 to compile. SWIG
is only needed if you want help work on Math::GSL and checkout code from the
Math::GSL git repository.
