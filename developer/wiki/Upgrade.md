# Upgrading to support a new version of GSL

## The travis build script

When upgrading to a new version, the travis CI builds will tell us
when something is not right. Currently we are building and testing
for 58 different setups (combinations of GSL version and perl version).

### Stage 1
For each setup, the build script first builds a CPAN distribution 
`Math-GSL-yy.xx.tar.gz` where `yy.xx` is the current version of the
the swig module, i.e. the same as `$MATH::GSL::VERSION`.

First the GSL version given by the GSL_CURRENT environment variable, see
`.travis.yml`, is downloaded and installed.

Then, `perl Build.PL` is run. It uses `gsl-config` to determine the
installed version of GSL on the system. Here you can change the `PATH`
environment variable before calling `perl Build.PL` in order for 
it to use another version of `GSL` if you have multiple versions
installed. In our case it determines that the GSL version given by
GSL_CURRENT is installed.

Then, `Build.PL` extracts the GSL version by running `gsl-config` and
writes this information to `swig/system.i`. Finally, it generates a script
called `Build`.

Next, the `Build` script is run, which will iterate through all the versions as given in
the `@ver2func` array in `inc/Ver2Func.pm`. For each version,
it first generates a `rename.i` file in the `swig/` directory
based on the version in `@ver2func` and then runs the `swig` command on all
interface files found in the `swig/` directory that also matches the
current subsystem information found in `@ver2func` for the current version.

The output of each `swig` call is a `.pm` file which is put in the `pm/`
directory, and a `.c` file which is put in the `xs/` directory.

After `Build` is finished, travis calls `Build dist` to generate a
CPAN distribution archive file. This will include all the files listed
in the `MANIFEST` file.

#### NOTE:

- No tests (the test files are in the `t/` directory) are run at
this stage.
- The generated distribution is independet of the `swig` program, so
  the distribution can be installed on a target machine that does not
  have `swig` installed.

### Stage 2

In this stage, the travis build script tries to build and test the CPAN
distribution generated in stage 1 above for the given system (one of
58 setups described above). So this stage is independent of the `swig`
binary.

First, if the GSL version given by `$GSL` is not installed, it will download
and install it.

Then it extracts the distribution in a separate directory, runs `perl Build.PL`,
`./Build`, and finally `./Build test` runs the tests as given in the
`/t` directory.

## What to do?

In order to upgrade to a new version of GSL:

### Update MANIFEST

Update the `MANIFEST` files to include the `.pm` and
`.c` files that will be generated by running `swig` from `./Build`. It
is usually not necessary
to run `Perl Build.pl; Build` to determine the file names. You can
simply look at the files currently in the `MANIFEST` file and deduce
what the new names will be.

### Update .tavis.yml

- First, update the GSL_CURRENT item in `global:` under the `env:`
  list to reflect the new version of GSL.

- Add the previous (i.e., the current before we did this upgrade) to the
  head of the `matrix:` list under the `env:` list.
- Consider removing unsupported GSL versions from the end of the list.
- Consider adding new versions of `perl` to the front of the `perl:` list.
- Consider deleting deprecated versions of `perl` from the end of the `perl:` list.



### Update Ver2Func.pm

This is the main part of the upgrading work, and it can be time consuming
depending on the number of new features that has been added. 

First, add a new hash entry to the end of the `@ver2func` array.
Now, all functions that are new to this version compared to the
previous version should be added in the `new` item of the hash.
How to determine which items are new? [TODO: find a simpler way to do
this?] The brute force approach is
to run the test suite repeatedly looking at the failed tests will
given an indication of the names of the new functions. 

When all the tests passes, we can be confident that we have added
most of the new functions. 

There can also be C structures that have been rewritten in the new
version compared to the old such that the names/fields in the structure are
different. Since swig generates accessor functions for the structures 
it will typically also lead to failed tests.

#### An example of a difficult case

When upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6: For GSL 2.5 the header
`gsl_spmatrix.h` looked like this (some comments removed for brevity):

#endif /* __GSL_SPMATRIX_H__ */

whereas in GSL 2.6, `gsl_spmatrix.h` looked like this:

```c
#ifndef __GSL_SPMATRIX_H__
#define __GSL_SPMATRIX_H__

enum
{
  GSL_SPMATRIX_COO = 0, /* coordinate/triplet representation */

void gsl_spmatrix_cumsum(const size_t n, int * c);

#endif /* __GSL_SPMATRIX_H__ */
```

so it had been completely refactored. This problem was solved in an
ad-hoc way be rewriting `Spmatrix.i` from (GSL 2.5)

```c

%module "Math::GSL::SparseMatrix"

%include "typemaps.i"
%include "gsl_typemaps.i"
%include "renames.i"
%include "system.i"
%{
    #include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix.h"
%}
%include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix.h"
%include "../pod/SparseMatrix.pod"
```

to (GSL 2.6) :

```c
%module "Math::GSL::SparseMatrix"
%include "typemaps.i"
%include "gsl_typemaps.i"
%include "renames.i"
%include "system.i"
%{
    #include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix.h"
%}
#if MG_GSL_NUM_VERSION >= 002006
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_double.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_complex_long_double.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_complex_float.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_long_double.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_uint.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_double.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_complex_double.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_char.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_uchar.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_int.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_short.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_float.h"
  %include "gsl/gsl_spmatrix_ushort.h"
#else
  %include "legacy/gsl-2.5/gsl_spmatrix.h"
#endif
%include "../pod/SparseMatrix.pod"
```
So for this complicated case we skipped the `rename.i` approach where
we just add new function names to `@ver2func` in `Ver2Func.pm` as
described above, and simply included the whole `gsl_spmatrix.h` header
file in the local `include/legacy` directory.
