    Following in the steps of other open source projects that
    eventually take over the world, here is the partial list
    of people who have contributed to Math::GSL and its supporting
    works.  It is sorted by name and formatted to allow easy
    grepping and beautification by scripts.
    The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W),
    description (D), github (U) and snail-mail address (S).

        Thanks,

        The Math::GSL Team
        PS: Yes, this looks remarkably like the many other CREDITS formats
