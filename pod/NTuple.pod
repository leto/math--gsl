=head1 NAME

Math::GSL::NTuple - Functions for creating and manipulating ntuples, sets of values

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is partially implemented. Patches Welcome!

    use Math::GSL::NTuple qw /:all/;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Here is a list of all the functions in this module :

=over

=cut

sub new
{
    my ($class,$values) = @_;
    my $this = {};
    my $ntuple = Math::GSL::NTuple::gsl_ntuple->new;
    $this->{_ntuple} = $ntuple;

    bless $this, $class;
}

sub raw
{
    return (shift)->{_ntuple};
}

=item * <gsl_ntuple_open($filename, $ntuple_data, $size)>

This function opens an existing ntuple file $filename for reading and returns a
pointer to a corresponding ntuple struct. The ntuples in the file must have size
$size. A pointer to memory for the current ntuple row $ntuple_data, which is an
array reference, must be supplied -- this is used to copy ntuples in and out of
the file.

=item * <gsl_ntuple_create>

This function creates a new write-only ntuple file $filename for ntuples of size
$size and returns a pointer to the newly created ntuple struct. Any existing
file with the same name is truncated to zero length and overwritten. A pointer
to memory for the current ntuple row $ntuple_data, which is an array reference,
must be supplied -- this is used to copy ntuples in and out of the file.


=item * <gsl_ntuple_write($ntuple)>

This function writes the current $ntuple $ntuple->{ntuple_data} of size
$ntuple->{size} to the corresponding file.

=item * <gsl_ntuple_bookdata($ntuple)>

This function is a synonym for gsl_ntuple_write.

=item * <gsl_ntuple_read($ntuple)>

This function reads the current row of the ntuple file for ntuple and stores the
values in $ntuple->{data}.

=item * <gsl_ntuple_project()>

=item * <gsl_ntuple_close($ntuple)>

This function closes the ntuple file ntuple and frees its associated allocated
memory.
