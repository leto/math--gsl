=head1 NAME

Math::GSL::Diff - Numerical differentiation routines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Math::GSL::Diff qw/:all/;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Here is a list of all the functions included in this module :

=over

=item C<gsl_diff_central>

This function computes the numerical derivative of the function f
at the point x using an adaptive central difference algorithm.
The result is an array where the first position is an error code (0 for success),
the second is derivative value, and the third is an estimate of its absolute error.

   my ($success, $result, $error) =
         gsl_diff_central(sub { return $_[0] ** 1.5 }, 2.0);

=item C<gsl_diff_backward>

This function computes the numerical derivative of the function f 
at the point x using an adaptive forward difference algorithm.
Its usage is similar to C<gsl_diff_central>.

   my ($success, $result, $error) =
          gsl_diff_backward(sub { return $_[0] ** 1.5 }, 0.0);


=item C<gsl_diff_forward>

This function computes the numerical derivative of the
function f at the point x using an adaptive backward difference algorithm.
Its usage is similar to C<gsl_diff_central>.

   my ($success, $result, $error) =
          gsl_diff_forward(sub { return $_[0] ** 1.5 }, 1.0);
